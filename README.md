# KameLion

Is a "try to organize" that project from JavierIH in a new, easy an functional site.

Of course i find Kame-8dof over internet, but itÂ´s a lot o unorganized information.

This is really because it scheint to be a programming freak people, but Kame is soooo nice, that is a beautiful project for parents the want to entusiasmate his children with tecnologie and robotic (my case)

First:
a bunch of 3d plastic is necesary. I find a good version in Thingiverse, from the original proyect from JavierIH. This parts are there, here in GibHub as JavierIH, and from p123ad too. Thanks a lot to both.



This is a 8DOF quadrupet robot controlled with ESP32 board.
Connection via Wifi and telnet protocol.

This build is based on the Project form [JavierIH](https://github.com/JavierIH/miniKame).
Some Parts are redesgined to fit a ESP32 Development board inside.

Here is a Picture of the finished Robot

Board pins can be set to match this scheme in the function init of minikame library. Example:
````
board_pins[0] = D1; // Servo S0
board_pins[1] = D4; // Servo S1
board_pins[2] = D8; // Servo S2
board_pins[3] = D6; // Servo S3
board_pins[4] = D7; // Servo S4
board_pins[5] = D5; // Servo S5
board_pins[6] = D2; // Servo S6
board_pins[7] = D3; // Servo S7
````
